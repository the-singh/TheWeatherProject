To run the project -

1. Please use Intellij IDE and Build & Run. No configuration needed.
2. Please change application.conf under src/main/resources for 'path_of_local'. This is the location where all the data files will be downloaded
   from the internet when the code runs.
3. You can trim down 'station_list' as running with full data in your local may be slow.

All the analysed output can be observed in console and the same will not be saved anywhere.
